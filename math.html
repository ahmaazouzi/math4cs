	<h2>Chapter 1: Combinatorics</h2>
	<h3>1.1 Factorials:</h3>
	<p>
		N! (called N factorial) is the product of the first N integers. It can be expressed as:
		\[N! = N \times (N - 1)\times (N - 2)\times (N - 3) \times ... \times 3 \times 2 \times 1\] 
	example:
	\[4! = 4 \times 3 \times 2 \times 1 = 24\]
	</p>
	<h3>1.2 Permutations:</h3>
	<p>A permutation is the number of ways a set of objects can be ordered. The following example shows the permutations of the 4 objects 1,2,3 and 4:
		\[1\,2\,3\,4\;\;\;\;2\,1\,3\,4\;\;\;\;3\,1\,2\,4\;\;\;\;4\,1\,2\,3 \]
		\[1\,2\,4\,3\;\;\;\;2\,1\,4\,3\;\;\;\;3\,1\,4\,2\;\;\;\;4\,1\,3\,2 \]
		\[1\,3\,2\,4\;\;\;\;2\,3\,1\,4\;\;\;\;3\,2\,1\,4\;\;\;\;4\,2\,1\,3 \]
		\[1\,3\,4\,2\;\;\;\;2\,3\,4\,1\;\;\;\;3\,2\,4\,1\;\;\;\;4\,2\,3\,1 \]
		\[1\,4\,2\,3\;\;\;\;2\,4\,1\,3\;\;\;\;3\,4\,1\,2\;\;\;\;4\,3\,1\,2 \]
		\[1\,4\,3\,2\;\;\;\;2\,4\,3\,1\;\;\;\;3\,4\,2\,1\;\;\;\;4\,3\,2\,1 \]
		An interesting obserbation about these permutations is that if the first number is removed from each of the 4 present columns, we end up with the the six permutations of the other 3 numbers not including the number removed. The columns in this example can be thought of as a groups of permutations.
	</p>
	<p>
		The general case of a permutation can be represented by:
		\[ P_N = N . P_{N - 1}\]
		or
		\[P_N = N!\]
	</p>
	<h3>1.3 Ordered Sets, Repetitions Allowed:</h3>
	<p>Imagine a box containing 5 balls A, B, C, D, E. You pull a ball out of the box, record its name and put it back in the box (repetition). You pull a second ball (it might be the same box as the first one), record its name next to the name of the first one (order) and put back. This case has two characteristics:<br>
		<ol>
			<li>The same element can appear more than once.</li>
			<li>The order in which the same element appears matters, meaning that \(A\,B\) is not the same \(B\,A\).</li>
		</ol>
	</p>
	<p>
		<b>Rule</b>: There are \(N^n\) different ordered sets of balls would result from \(n\) picks (trials)from a box containing \(N\) balls.
	</p>
	<p>
		<b>Examples:</b> Flipping coins a number of times, rolling a dice.
	</p>
	<h3>
		1.4 Ordered Sets, Repetitions Not Allowed:
	</h3>
	<p>
		How many different sets of ordered \(n\) objects can be drawn from a set \(N\) of objects without repetition. This is partially similar to the previous case, except that you can't repeat the trials (You can't put a ball back in the box).
	</p>
	<p>
		<b>Rule:</b> The number of ordered sets of \(n\) objects from \(N\) objects without repetition can be denoted by \(_NP_n\) and and be solved by the following pattern, Given that \(n \leq N\):
		\[ _NP_n = N(N - 1)(N - 2) ... (N - (n-1)) \]
		This is equivalent to:
		\[ _NP_n = {N! \over (N - n)!} \]

	</p>
	<p>
		<b>Examples:</b> Drawing a committee of 4 people from 13 candidates where each member assumes a specific position. Once  a candidate is picked, s/he can't be re-picked.
		 
	</p>
	<h3>
		1.5 Unordered Sets, Repetitions Not Allowed:
	</h3>
	<p>
		How many different sets of unordered \(n\) objects can be drawn from a set of \(N\) objects without repetitions? This scenario builds on the previous one. Because the order doesn't matter \(ABC = ACB = BAC = CBA\). To eliminate the repeated sets containing the same objects in different orderings, we simply divide the result from 1.4 by \(n!\) as in:
		\[ {{_N P_n} \over {n!}} = {{N!}\over{n!(N-n)!}}\]
	</p>
	<p>
		<b>Rule:</b> The number of unordered sets of \(n \) objects  where repetition is not allowed, from a given set \(N \) is equivalent to the <i>binomial coefficient</i> which is denoteed by:
		\[ _NC_n = {\binom N n} = {{N!}\over{n!(N -n)!}} \]
		\(\binom N n\) stands for "\(N\) choose \(n\)"" while \( C\) in \( _NC_n\)stands for "Combinations".
	</p>
	<p>
		<b>Interesting observation:</b> Any two binomial coefficients With \( N\) nominator whose \( n\)'s values add up to \( N\) have the same value, hence \[ {\binom 6 4} = {\binom 6 2} = 15\] 
	</p>
	<p>
		<b>Easy way to count binomial coefficients:</b> limit the number of permutations of the nominator by the value of the denominator. For example:
		\[ {\binom 6 4} \]
		the nominator here is 6 and the denominator is 4. This results in:
		\[ {{6\,.\,5\,.\,4\,.\,3}\over{4!}}\] 
	</p>
	<p>
		<b>Examples:</b> 
		<ul>
			<li>
				Drawing a committee of 4 people from 13 candidates where all members are equivalent. Once  a candidate is picked, s/he can't be re-picked.
			</li>
			<li>
				Drawing a committee of 7 from 10 people where you have 1 president, 2 vice-presidents, and 4 secretaries. Since the order doesn't matter you can pick either president, secretaries or vices first. The following two cases are equivalent:
				<br><b>case 1</b>
				\[ 
				{\binom {10} 1} {\binom 9 2} {\binom 7 4} =
				{10\over{1!}} \,.\, {{9\,.\,8}\over{2}} \,.\, {{7\,.\,6\,.\,5\,.\,4}\over{4!}}
				\]
				<b>case 2</b>				\[ 
				{\binom {10} 4} {\binom 6 2} {\binom 4 1} =
				{{10\,.\,9\,.\,8\,.\,7}\over{4!}} \,.\, {{6\,.\,5}\over{2!}} \,.\, {4 \over{1!}}
				\]

			</li>
		</ul>
	</p> 
	<h3>
		1.7 Unordered Sets, Repetitions Allowed:
	</h3>
	<p>
		How many different sets of unordered \(n\) objects can be drawn from a set of \(N\) objects where repetitions are allowed? This not as common as the previous two scenarios. It can be solved by the <b>stars and bars</b> analogy, where stars represent the lines separating groups of similar object, and each star represents an objects: for example let's draw \( n = 5\) from set \(\{A, B, C\}\) whose \( N = 3\). One of the possibilities is:
		is:
		\[\,A, A, A, B, B\]
		This one can be represented  by:
		\[\star\,\,\star\,\,\star\,\star\,|\star\,\,\star\,\,|\]
		and:
		\[ B,B,B,B,C\]
		can be represented by:
		\[ | \star\,\,\star\,\,\star\,\star\,|\star\,\,\star\,\,\]
		Notice that there is always one less bar than N, because obviously one bar is enough to separate two stars and 2 bars are enough to separate 3 stars. This stars and bars trick results in the follwing rule.
		<b>Rule:</b> The number of unordered sets of \(n \) objects with replacement from a given set \(N \) results from:
		\[ _NU_n = {\binom {n + (N - 1)} {N - 1} } \]
		Where U stands for "unordered".
	</p>
	<p>
		<b>Examples:</b> 
		<ul>
			<li>5 dice are rolled all at once for 3 times.</li>
			<li>Distribute 10 dollars among 4 people, where each person can receive a sum between 0 and 10 dollars. This is a little confusing and tricky on purpose. Your \( N\)here is 4, while \( n\) is 10. Name the 4 people \( A,B,C,D\), put them in a box, pull them one at a time and write the name until you reach 10. The rest is arithmetic.</li>
		</ul>
	</p>
	<h3>1.8 Binomial Coefficients:</h3>
	<h4>1.8.1 Coins and Pascal Triangles:</h4>
	<p>
		Constructing a Pascal triangle can be achieved through successive  incremental coin flips. The tip of the triangle is made by a zero flip, next to it a 1 flip.. etc. as we get farther from the two sides of the triangle (It's essentially an isosceles triangle), the number of ways of getting heads or tails increases and vice versa. If you flip a coin 6 times, there are 20 ways that 3 heads can be scored, while there is only 1 way that 1 or 6 heads can be gotten.
	</p>
	<p>
		Basically Pascal triangle is pyramid of binomial coefficients. The nominators of these binomial coefficients increase as you move downwards. The denominators increase as you move from left to right. Each row of BC's has the same nominator. The denominators within that row increase from left to right.  
	</p>
	<p>
		There are \( \binom n k \) ways that \( k\) heads can come up in \( k\) coin flips! This also applies the committee, where a committee of \( k\) members can be drawn from a group of \( n\) people.
	</p>
	<h4>1.8.2 \( (a + b)^n\) and Pascal Triangles:</h4>
	<p>
		The sum of a row in PT (Pascal Triangle) is as follows:
		\[ {\binom n 0} + {\binom n 1} + {\binom n 2} + ... + {\binom n {n - 1}} + {\binom n n}\]
		This subsection is about binomial expansion, Algebra 2!! What the lambda!!?
		<br> Basically, BC is used to count the number of ways \( k\) can be chosen from \( n\) things, unordered and without repetitions.

	<h2>
		Chapter 2: Probability:
	</h2>
	<h3>
		2.1 Preliminary:
	</h3>
	<p>
		Probability is represented by a fraction of the number of desired outcomes over the total number if possibilities outcomes as in:
		\[ P = { {number \,of \,desired \,outcomes} \over {total\, number\, of \,possibilities \,outcomes}}\]
		A lot of rambling! Averages and as the number of trials get larger and larger, the actual desired outcomes will get closer and closer to their probabilities.
	</p>
	<h3>2.2 Rules of Probability:</h3>
	<p>
		The rules of probability apply to multiple events rather than a single even like tossing a dice. These rules deal with questions like what's the likelihood of both events occurring or what's the probability of either event happening?
	</p>
	<h4>2.2.1 AND: The Intersection Probability \( P(A \,and\, B)\):</h4>
	<p>
		Let A and B represent two events, something like tossing a coin twice. What is the probability that both events occur (<i>joint probability</i>)? The two events can be either independent or dependent
	</p>
	<h4>Independent events:</h4>
	<p>
		This includes rolling 2 dice. The two dice have no effect on each other. An other example is picking a card that's both a king and a heart.
